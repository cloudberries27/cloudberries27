My name is Claudia Rodriguez (but on the web I go by Cloud Berries) and I'm a Software/Web Developer. I graduated from NYU in 2020 with a
BS in Computer Science and minors in Cybersecurity and Digital Media.

## &#x270d; Yes I have a blog...

Like any typical programmer, I do in fact have a blog. However, it actually isn't dedicated to coding. I run a book blog and it started when I got Covid and basically
had to quarantine for 2 weeks. I was so bored out of my mind (now thinking about it, this probably would've been a good time to study programming) I ended up reading I think 
ten books or so. I don't really have any bookworm friends so please follow my insta @fanamerainc if you're a Potterhead or a Sarah J Maas fan.
